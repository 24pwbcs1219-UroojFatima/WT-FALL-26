# Lab 01 Reflection

During this lab, I learned how to use Git for version control. I practiced creating and updating files, writing HTML, and managing commits. I also learned how to create and switch between branches, and how merging works. Working with GitHub gave me a better understanding of how real-world projects are managed.
